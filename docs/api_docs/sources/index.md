## Atlas Documentation 

Atlas is a flexible Machine Learning platform that consists of a Python SDK, CLI, GUI & Scheduler to help Machine Learning Engineering teams dramatically reduce the model development time & reduce effort in managing infrastructure.

Atlas is a subset of *Foundations* which is a group of tools we have built for Machine Learning Engineers.

### BETA Note

Atlas has evolved quite a lot throughout our history. The latest open-source version of Atlas includes a lot of architectural and design changes. 

**This version is currently in BETA.**

### Here are some of the core features:

**Experiment Management & Tracking:**
<br>Tag experiments and easily track hyperparameters, metrics, and artifacts such as images, GIFs, and audio clips in a web-based GUI to track the performance of your models

![GUI](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/29a4f1_c8d1a4f9ab1941ab9ade5e934cf8b149~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1440,h_1024/tumour.png "Artifact GUI")

**Job queuing & scheduling:** <br>Launch and queue thousands of experiment variations to fully utilize your system resources

**Collaboration & Bookkeeping:** <br>Keep a journal of thoughts, ideas, and comments on projects

**Reproducibility:** <br>
Maintain an audit trail of every single experiment you run, complete with code and any saved items

**Authentication & other integrations:** <br>
Collaborate across your team by seting up Atlas on a cluster and aproviding user access controls via [KeyCloak integration](atlas-modes/authentication.md).

Slice and dice your models from the GUI via the [Tensorboard](gui.md) integration.

## How does Atlas Work?
Atlas consists of the following core modules:

* [GUI](gui.md) - A Dockerized web application to view job status for various projects.  
* Foundations [SDK](sdk-reference/SDK.md) & [CLI](cli.md) - A programmatic and command-line interfaces for Atlas.
* [Local Scheduler](atlas-modes/scheduling.md) - A scheduler which is used for job orchestration and management.

Here is an example workflow: 

1. Install Atlas on your machine or on the Cloud 
2. Use the SDK to log various metrics, hyperparameters or use the `submit` SDK command to automate submission of jobs for e.g:
```python
# main.py

import foundations 

foundations.log_metrics('accuracy', acc)
foundations.log_param('batch_size', 64)

foundations.save_artifact('loss_graph', loss_plt)

foundations.submit(scheduler_config="scheduler"
                    command=["main.py"],
                    num_gpus=1,
                    stream_job_logs=False)
```
3. Use the Foundations CLI to submit your jobs to your local or remote machine (or cluster).
```bash
foundations submit my_aws_scheduler_instance . main.py --num-gpus=3
```
4. Atlas packages your code into a container, reviews resources available, schedules and executes your job and displays the results on the [GUI](gui.md).
