## Atlas Documentation 

Atlas is a flexible Machine Learning platform that consists of a Python SDK, CLI, GUI & Scheduler to help Machine Learning Engineering teams dramatically reduce the model development time & reduce effort in managing infrastructure.

Here are some of the core features:

**Experiment Management & Tracking:**
<br>Tag experiments and easily track hyperparameters, metrics, and artifacts such as images, GIFs, and audio clips in a web-based GUI to track the performance of your models

**Job queuing & scheduling:** <br>Launch and queue thousands of experiment variations to fully utilize your system resources

**Collaboration & Bookkeeping:** <br>Keep a journal of thoughts, ideas, and comments on projects

**Reproducibility:** <br>
Maintain an audit trail of every single experiment you run, complete with code and any saved items

## How does Atlas Work?
Atlas consists of the following core modules:

* GUI - A Dockerized web application to view job status for various projects.  
* Foundations SDK & CLI - A programmatic and command-line interfaces for Atlas.
![CODE](assets/images/foundations_code.png)   
* Local Scheduler - A scheduler which is used for job orchestration and management.

You can also check out the [CLI](cli.md) and the [SDK](sdk-reference/SDK.md) reference documentation to find further information.
