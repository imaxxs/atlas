    Any jobs that you have run are archived within `~/.foundations/job_data/archive`. If you have code or data that you wish to keep around, you should copy them to a safe location.
    
    Additionaly, any metadata is stored in a Redis backup file in `~/.foundations/database/dump.rdb`. You may want to back this up if there is important information from jobs that have run.

 1. Run `rm -rf ~/.foundations`
