# Windows 10 Installation

### Installation

*Estimated time: 10 minutes*

#### Prerequisites

 1. Docker version \>18.09
    1. Windows 10 Home edition users can set up Atlas by installing [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/).
    2. Windows 10 Enterprise edition users should use [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/).
 2. Python \>=3.6
 3. \>5GB of free machine storage
 4. The `atlas_installer.py` file.
    - Download the latest release from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/dessa-oss/atlas/releases)

#### Steps

 1. Create a new, empty directory where you will install Atlas.

 2. Copy the `atlas_installer.py` file into this directory.

 3. Create and activate a Python \>=3.6 virtual environment using 
 [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands)
 or [venv](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)
 to minimize dependency issues.
 4. Install the following python package into the environment created in step 3: `pip install pypiwin32==223`
 5. Run the install script with `python atlas_installer.py`
 6. _Windows 10 Home only_: 
    - Open Oracle VirtualBox.
    - Right-click on the docker VM and click on `Settings`.
    - Select 'Network' in the configuration pane, expand the `Advanced` section and click on `Port Forwarding`.
    - Add the following port forwarding rules:

| Name | Protocol | Host IP | Host Port | Guest IP | Guest Port |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-----------|----------|------------|
| Scheduler | TCP | 127.0.0.1 | 5000 |  | 5000 |
| GUI | TCP | 127.0.0.1 | 5555 |  | 5555 |
| Tracker | TCP | 127.0.0.1 | 5556 |  | 5556 |
| Archive | TCP | 127.0.0.1 | 5557 |  | 5557 |
| Tboard | TCP | 127.0.0.1 | 5959 |  | 5959 | 


### Start-up

After completing the [installation section](#installation), you can do the following to start Atlas:

 1. Validate that you are in the same Python environment that was used to run the installation script.
 2. Run `atlas-server start`.

#### GPU Mode
If you installed Atlas with GPU support, you can start the Atlas server in GPU mode by running `atlas-server start -g`. This will allow Atlas to use all CUDA-enabled GPUs on your system.

    Validate that the GUI is running by going to the [GUI](http://localhost:5555). This is your centralized location to track all of your experiments.

### Hello Atlas

After completing the [start-up section](#start-up), follow the next few steps to launch your first Atlas job:

 1. Navigate to where you'd like to create your Atlas project directory.
 2. Ensure that you are in the environment that was used during installation.
 2. Run `foundations init hello-atlas` to create an example project.
 3. Navigate into the newly created `hello-atlas` directory.
 4. Run the sample code provided by running `python main.py`.
 5. Head to the [GUI](http://localhost:5555/projects) to see your experiment!


!!! Note
    When you run a job for the first time, it will download the appropriate worker image needed. <br>This will take roughly 1.5 minutes.
